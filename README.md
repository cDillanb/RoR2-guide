# RoR2 Guide

## Elevator pitch: 
#####    A web application that allows users to get info about items and characters from the game "Risk of Rain 2"
#####    using searches. users can also log in and track their challenge progress. (Like a Wiki with a progress tracker)

## MVP:
* Users can log in
* Users can search for items/characters
* Users can check off challenges they have completed/ characters they have unlocked
* Users can leave comments on each item page
* Users can view details about items, characters, and challenges
